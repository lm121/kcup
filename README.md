# Network Intrusion Detection
This project uses three algorithms including logistic regression, decision tree and kmeans to 
tackle the network intrusion competition in KDD Cup 1999 with python and Spark. 


## Setup
Download the datasets from [here](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html).
Assume the dataset folder is stored in a folder named "datasets" at the same directory level of the kcup repository. 
If that is not the case, please change the "dataDir" variable in ./script/runKCup.sh


## Run 
./script runKCup.sh
